# AI agent - Algorithms and Data Structures

# Intro 
In order to understand how an AI agent works and how to buid using prompts, we completed the following task from our ALDA class. The code generated by the AI agent will be included in the files from the repo. 

## Intructions 

•	Task: Build an AI Agent (or a sophisticated prompt engineering loop) that can solve 5-10 algorithmic problems of a specific type (e.g., "Dynamic Programming problems from Cormen" or "Codeforces Graph problems").

•	Workflow:

o	Input: The text of the problem.

o	Process: The Agent breaks down the problem, identifies the sub-structure, selects the algorithm.

o	Output: Python code that solves it + Time Complexity explanation.

•	Evidence: Show the Agent solving problems it hasn't seen before. It could be in an iterative way, meaning you work with the agent/chat to tackle problems.


We decided to create a complete professional prompt to ChatGPT, since its the best AI in terms of reasoning. This prompt complies with the instructions and conditions given and chooses the best method from a given list in the prompt. 

## Prompt

Full prompt (~1400 words) available on the following document: [Prompt_AI_Agent](https://pruebacorreoescuelaingeduco-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/angela_gomez-v_mail_escuelaing_edu_co/IQAfpOuVpbmxQJVVstT8-8tMAQtzuVM1ryPZwUhaBFZ0e9U?e=ahc6Pr)
# Exercises
Although the instrructions asks us for an AI agent that is capable of solving from 5 to 10 problems from the same family topic, we will show 3 of them - where all of them are new to the AI agent. he solutions are available in the folders. However, if you want to check for more problems related to algorithms and data structures, the prompt for the AI agent should work fine :)

## Problem 1
Problem: [Queue at the School](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/266/B)

Topics: Constructive algorithm, graph matching, shortest paths. 

## Problem 2
Problem: [Love Triangle](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/939/A)

Topics: graphs. 

## Problem 3
Problem: [Sloth](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/891/D)

Topic: dfs and smiliar, dp, trees. 

# Conclusions

- With the help of the agent oriented toward solving algorithmic problems, it demonstrates a strong capacity to generate a well-structured analysis. It correctly interprets the problem statement, identifies the core issue, and selects the appropriate strategy to generate a coherent solution. This reflects an effective application of language models as tools for computational reasoning, showing that AI can be used as strong support for technical problem-solving in the field of algorithms.

- One of the most relevant aspects of the project is that it is not based on training a proprietary model, but rather on the strategic design of a well-structured prompt. This demonstrates that prompt engineering can be sufficient to transform a general-purpose model into an agent specialized in a specific domain. In this sense, the project not only solves problems but also highlights the importance of instruction design as a key component in the development of functional AI agents.

- The project has a strong academic focus, as it does not limit itself to generating code but also includes explanations of the applied logic and computational complexity of the solutions. This makes it a useful tool for reinforcing learning in data structures and algorithm analysis. However, from a technical perspective, the project could be strengthened by incorporating automated testing, edge-case validation, and a more scalable structure that allows systematic evaluation of multiple problems. Even so, as a functional prototype and demonstration of capabilities, it adequately fulfills its purpose and establishes a solid foundation for future improvements.
