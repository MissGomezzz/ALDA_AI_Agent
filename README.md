# AI agent - Algorthims and Data Structures

# Intro 
In order to understand how an AI agent works and how to buid using prompts, we completed the following task from our ALDA class. The code generated by the AI agent will be included in the files from the repo. 

## Intructions 

•	Task: Build an AI Agent (or a sophisticated prompt engineering loop) that can solve 5-10 algorithmic problems of a specific type (e.g., "Dynamic Programming problems from Cormen" or "Codeforces Graph problems").

•	Workflow:

o	Input: The text of the problem.

o	Process: The Agent breaks down the problem, identifies the sub-structure, selects the algorithm.

o	Output: Python code that solves it + Time Complexity explanation.

•	Evidence: Show the Agent solving problems it hasn't seen before. It could be in an iterative way, meaning you work with the agent/chat to tackle problems.


We decided to create a complete professional prompt to ChatGPT, since its the best AI in terms of reasoning. This prompt complies with the instructions and conditions given and chooses the best method from a given list in the prompt. 

## Prompt

Full prompt (~1430 words) avaiable on the following document: [Prompt_AI_Agent](https://pruebacorreoescuelaingeduco-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/angela_gomez-v_mail_escuelaing_edu_co/IQAfpOuVpbmxQJVVstT8-8tMAQtzuVM1ryPZwUhaBFZ0e9U?e=ahc6Pr)
# Exercises
Although the instrructions asks us for an AI agent that is capable of solving from 5 to 10 problems from the same family topic, we will show 3 of them - where all of them are new to the AI agent. However, if you want to check for more problems related to algorithms and data structures, the prompt for the AI agent should work fine :)
